- 👋 Hi, I’m @duhhbzz, I have a website! www.duhhbzz.com <-- 

- 👀 I’m interested in programming. I don't have a specific concentration yet, just trying out little by
by little until I can determine a favorite to pursue.

- 🌱 I currently work in Support for IT, but have aspirations and focus to move into development or a System administrative role. I hold an undergraduate degree in information technology along with a certification from the same university for Advanced Software Developement. I am on track to soon start pursuing a graduate degree in the same focus.

- 💞️ As I progress in my studies I plan to involve in community projects and give back what I've learned.

- 📫 You can find me on twitter or other social medias with the username @itsduhhbzz or @duhhbzz
