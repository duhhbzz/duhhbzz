- 👋 Hi, I’m @duhhbzz

- 👀 I’m interested in programming. I don't have a specific concentration yet, just trying out little by
by little until I can determine a favorite to pursue.

- 🌱 I’m currently working on a Bachelors' Degree in Information Technology alongside a certification through
my university they call, "Advanced Software Development"

- 💞️ As I progress in my studies I plan to involve in community projects and give back what I've learned.

- 📫 You can find me on twitter or other social medias with the username @itsduhhbzz or @duhhbzz
